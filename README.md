# Product Card 

The product card is a component to view the details of a product for sale. It was designed to be used in web applications. In development you can go beyond what is proposed, including animations, for example.
This challenge was created for #boracodar, a Rocketseat project with weekly challenges for you to practice developing as you see fit and evolve your code to the next level.
